# Feature Question Bank

## Business Interrogation
1. Why does this matter? Business case, cost of not doing it, cost of delay.
2. Who is affected? Users, systems, teams, downstream effects.
3. What does success look like? Measurable changes, metrics, behavior changes.
4. What are the boundaries? What is this NOT? Adjacent scope we're not touching? Tempting scope creep?
5. What has been tried before? Prior art in codebase? Previous attempts? Why abandoned?
6. What are the risks? Failure modes, blast radius if it breaks.

## Technical Deep-Dive
7. What exists already? Related code, patterns, abstractions. Extend or build new?
8. What's the data model? Entities, relationships, storage, migrations.
9. What are the integration points? APIs, databases, queues, external services.
10. What are the edge cases? Error states, race conditions, empty states, permission boundaries.
11. What are the performance constraints? Latency budgets, data volume, concurrency.
12. What's the testing strategy? Automatic vs manual verification, test infrastructure.
