Since this project now has a TypeScript codebase with `bun run typecheck` as the primary quality gate, update the quality gates section to include the actual command.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. Replace the commented-out placeholder commands in the Quality Gates section of `.super-ralph/AGENTS.md` with the actual project commands:\n   - Typecheck: `bun run typecheck`\n2. Keep the existing structure and explanatory text\n3.

If not, update it to ignore beads.db and any WAL/SHM files (beads.db-wal, beads.db-shm)\n3. The issues.jsonl, config.yaml, and metadata.json files MUST remain tracked\n4.
