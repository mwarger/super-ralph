{{!-- Forward Phase: beads -> code --}}
{{!-- The agent picks which ready bead to work on (pure Ralph). --}}

## Your Mission

You are one iteration of a Ralph loop. You have a fresh context — no memory of previous iterations. Your job: pick one ready bead from the epic, implement it, and signal completion.

## Epic: {{epicId}}

## Using `br` to Get Context

You have the `br` CLI available. Use it to discover and inspect beads:
- `br ready --parent {{epicId}} --json` — list all ready (unblocked) beads you can work on
- `br show <bead-id>` — full details for any bead (description, acceptance criteria, dependencies)
- `br show {{epicId}} --json` — epic overview with all children and their status
- `br dep tree <bead-id>` — dependency tree for a bead

Start by running `br ready --parent {{epicId}} --json` to see what's available, then pick the most important one.

## Recent Progress Notes

{{/if}}

## Workflow

1. Read AGENTS.md and README.md if they exist.
2. Read `.super-ralph/progress.md` for learnings from previous iterations.
3. Review the ready beads above. Pick the most important one.
4. Use `br show <bead-id>` to get full details for the bead you picked.
5. If you need context about completed beads (e.g., what a dependency implemented), use `br show` to look them up.
6. Search the codebase before implementing. Do not assume anything.
7. Implement the bead following its acceptance criteria exactly.
8. Run all quality gate commands. Fix any failures.
9. Self-review: every acceptance criterion met, no scope creep, no placeholders.
10. Commit with message: `feat: <bead-id> - <bead-title>`
11. Close the bead: `br close <bead-id>`
12. Update `.super-ralph/progress.md` with learnings.
13. Call `task_complete` with `status: "complete"`.

## Completion Signals

- `task_complete({ status: "complete" })` — You implemented and closed one bead. Loop continues.
- `task_complete({ status: "blocked" })` — You can't proceed. Explain why.
- `task_complete({ status: "failed" })` — Something went wrong. Explain what.
