description: "Apply an urgent minimal fix through the super-ralph pipeline"
---

Invoke the super-ralph:superpowers-intake skill with work_type = "hotfix".

The user's message after this command (if any) is the hotfix description. Use it as starting context.

Hotfix intake is minimal — ask only:
1. What's broken?
2. What's the fix?

Skip the design doc. Skip the refinement loop. Produce a minimal PRD with 1-3 beads. Go straight to beads and launch.

Pipeline: minimal intake (1-2 questions) → PRD (1-3 stories) → beads → launch.
