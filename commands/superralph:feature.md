description: "Start building a new feature through the full super-ralph pipeline"
---

Invoke the super-ralph:superpowers-intake skill with work_type = "feature".

The user's message after this command (if any) is the seed description for the feature. Use it as starting context for the intake, but still run the full relentless intake protocol.

Pipeline: full intake → design doc → refinement loop → PRD → beads → launch.
